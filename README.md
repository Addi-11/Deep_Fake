# Deep Fakes
*Inspired by introduction video of MIT's course [6.S191](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)*

### Repo Goals
* **Face Substitution**
  - [ ] Adding Face Detection
  - [ ] Face tracking through video frames
  - [ ] Developing GAN to face style transfer
  - [ ] Face Substitution
  - [ ] Training on new data
  
* **Voice Cloning**<br>
Implementation to follow the paper [Text to Speech Synthesis using Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf)<br>
